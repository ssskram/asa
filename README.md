# Active Shooter Archive

## Premise
The immediate erasure of the digital identities of mass shoters prohibits efforts to understand what pushes people to commit such acts. The narrative surrounding the individual gets filtered and distorted to fit a specific model as defined through channels of media and previous incidents. It is important to collect all information to gain a full understanding of the individual, and this information should be freely accessible for the public to view and make their own judgements without corporate news bias.
